## Pleasant or UnPleasent

In this repository we make an attempt to understand the interesting interplay between the adversarial processes of "defence" and "attack" acts, by making each confront with the next, in the context of (online) game ut99, cheat and anti-cheat software development. 

From the security side, the so called anti-cheat side:

```All security concerns, from computation to politics and biology, come down to averting the adversarial processes in the environment, that are poised to subvert the goals of the system"```
Dusko Pavlovic, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.5542). The paper, in effect, supports the contention that the arrangements which force the attacker (cheater) to overcome, at minimum, the complexity equal to that of proofing P != NP, which is not only limited to the sum of attacking computer algorithms (and which may even include the air they breathe!, imagines me), for successful attack, are "satisfactory" for the price of the asset, protected by the "obscurity" thus tackled by the attacker, loss. Hence the phrase "security by obscurity" which has the reputation of getting mis-interpreted as "hide the source code of computer software for better security".

Welcome to Grims Build-A-Bot :] hoo haa

Special thanks to everyone i know at utcheats.com ;)

Ok welcome.

Ok first a minor note:

First this is not a SHIT HO politically correct 'Ouch i forgot a semicolon' Migrainsoft Whinedows manual 
so be prepared for mistakes and shit. This is again a Grim-Hump-It-Down-In-Notepad-In-ten-Point-two-Minutes tutorial.

This tutorial is specifically built to give you a platform to build a bot on.
Helios Tutorial for a honeybot CAN be ported into this cheating platform davido
my m8 from italy did it using my guidance and he has pretty little programming experience.

SO THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE BOT!!!! WHY COS I AINT GOT T3H TIME AND THERES NOTHING LIKE YOUR OWN BOT ;).

Anyone with more than a mushy-pee for a brain can do this shit. Porting a bot to it is slightly harder
but anyone motivated to learn; this is your time and place cos it don't get better than this trust me.
I worked hard to make these hacks and you get to use them :). I waited for ut2k4 progress to get far
so they can't smart up off of info of this bot/hack.

AND SINCE 2 PEEPS WERE TOO PISSED TO RTFM A .org IS AN ORIGINAL COPY OF YOUR OLD .u FILE!!!!!


Let's Rock

What we want is an online aimbot :) Lemme hear ya say YEAAHHHHH!!!!! ... YEAHHHH!!!

We need to stick it somewhere .... hrmmmm Engine.u is a good place but
we want more access to lower packages but we want raw power of Engine.u.

So we do both. I use xWebAdmin and Engine.u.


This tut is built up in 6 parts.

- Explanation on how the shit comes together
- Export the code
- The bot basis
- Compiling the bot basis
- The bot itself
- Compiling the bot
- MD5 Ownage


Explanation on how the shit comes together
--------------------------------------------

It is not nessecary to understand this but it helps if you want to be a botbuilder.

The method i use to be able to access all entities ingame is called delegation
in other words i make a base class my BWF_Base which works like a JAVA interface. I then
use HUD class to pust a PostRender to it and i use Console.uc to launch it and push Tick requests
to it and assign the ViewportOwner.

Due to Engine.u limitations (crashes etc.) i had to reuse a variable to locate my bot in this is 
the Focus variable which isn't used in online play.

Then using dynamicloadobject i load up my bot which extends my BWF_Base and it will then due to my
system will automagically get Tick, PostRender, Spawned, Destroyed calls when you override them.
PreRender wasn't hooked last time i checked.

NOTE: Because the variables like ViewportOwner are passed after spawn be aware of the fact that
      they will be None at spawn. So DONT do shit like  PC = ViewportOwner.Actor; in Spawned().
      Ok let me put it like this DONT USE SPAWNED!!!!.


Export the code
------------------

-Open up unrealed
-Click the pawn icon in the toolbar
-Batch export all scripts

This will generate all the .uc files. You can also download em from EPIC.



The bot basis
------------------

The bot basis exists out of two parts.

- The base class  (BWF_Base.uc)
- The initiators   (Console.uc, HUD.uc)

The base class is a class that can be overridden. This way we can dynamically 
load a different package object. (our bot).

The initiator is the class hooking all calls to our base class and since our 
bot overrides the base class it too will get those calls.



Compiling the base into Engine.u
---------------------------------

- Chuck the two files into the /Engine/Classes dir.

// If recompiling skip this step
- Copy Engine.u to Engine.org (Only once you need an untouched copy of Engine.u)

- Delete Engine.u (check if the .org file exists)
- Ucc make
- ucc conform Engine.u Engine.org

Boner!!! we're done already :)



The bot itself
----------------

The bot itself is located in a lower package xWebAdmin is best imo.

The bot must extend the BWF_Base and have the same name as specified in Console.uc.
In this example file it was BWF_Aimbot.uc.

We already have the xWebAdmin exported so it's another chuck 'n complile cycle.


Ok chuck in your code into BWF_Aimbot.uc :]


- Chuck the two files into the /xWebAdmin/Classes dir.

- Send me an email which second file you chucked in cos it's only 1 hehehe gotcha :P

// If recompiling skip this step
- Copy xWebAdmin.u to xWebAdmin.org (Only once you need an untouched copy of Engine.u)

- Delete xWebAdmin.u (check if the .org file exists)
- Ucc make
- ucc conform xWebAdmin.u xWebAdmin.org



Ok if i typed this tut correctly you should have yourself a working propper aimbot ready
for online ownage in ut2k3. BUT MD5 uhhh oohhhhh.



MD5 Ownage
----------------

Ok i'll assume you have my proxy ;)

minor note:

RRRRR   TTTTTTTT  FFFFFFF   MMM  MMM     !!
RR   R     TT     FF       MM  MM  MM    !!
RRRRRR     TT     FFFFF    MM  MM   MM   !!
RR  R      TT     FF      MM        MM
RR   R     TT     FF      MM        MM   !!

(yes it has a manual my proxy)

Well you need to run the following commands in DOS prompt.

1.  ucc mastermd5 -q Engine.u
2.  ucc mastermd5 -f Engine.u
3.  ucc mastermd5 -q xWebAdmin.u
4.  ucc mastermd5 -f xWebAdmin.u

As you can see you will get MD5 values (the 32 char long hex thingies)

in BWF_SearchReplaceList.ini set the following (sections exist)

; Engine.u
; QuickMD5
SearchString[6]=<MD5 value of command 1 goes here>
ReplaceString[6]=7c07dc2b72044ef0e6278707e9e8b0f6
; FullMD5
SearchString[7]=<MD5 value of command 2 goes here>
ReplaceString[7]=c58cb829f4af69ac167b80f3d39751e0


; xWebAdmin.u
; QuickMD5
SearchString[52]=<MD5 value of command 3 goes here>
ReplaceString[52]=643cfed13fffadc86433b14159c936da
; FullMD5
SearchString[53]=<MD5 value of command 4 goes here>
ReplaceString[53]=f6d6acbf46b208f064c2cc41246798dd


As you've noticed xInterface has already been set for the one supplied by the proxy.

Other than that the modified ini goes in the system dir.

Read the proxy readme if questions.

Make sure the proxy is running.




Don't quit keep trying someday it'll work.
